## Overview

It is a replication of google image search engine for finding similar images in our database using artificial intelligence. It is a project which uses cosine distance or finding the similarity which is an amazing application of cosine similarity.

## Motivation

When we are searching some thing in google there is a option in right of search bar i.e image search. When I noticed it I started thinking of its working and researched and started a project similar to it using deep learning.

## Technical Aspect
## Installation
1. If you like my project do üåüüåü my repository.

2. Clone my repository by using following command in terminal/Command Prompt.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ksdkamesh99/Social-Distance-Detector.git
```

3. Now we need to install required libraries like opencv,spacy etc.  

## To Do in future:-
1. UI of website need to be improved.

2. Need to add some more images in the dataset so as to improve the accuracy.
